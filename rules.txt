comments:
- use >> << or ^ to point a comment to the part of a patch it describes
- start all sentences with a capital letter and end them with a dot
- when writing a nodes name, like "Quad" then start it with a capital letter
- don't write "Here we/you have to set this&that." but say "Here this&that is set."

patching:
- follow: http://vvvv.org/documentation/conventions.nodeandpinnaming
- all non default pin values should be set via an IOBox
- try to avoid Map nodes after Linear/RandomSpread (as they can already map to a value range)
